A very simple library for locating OS-preferred directories for applications to use for various purposes (such as logging, temporary data, user scripts, etc). Currently provides implementations for Windows, OS X/Cocoa, and FreeDesktop.org compliant *nixes. Intended to be accessed through JNA, so the API is pretty simple and doesn't expose anything other than c-strings and ints.

The name is intended to be some kind of joke about "native" and "art" and "folders".

Do with this code as you please, with no guarantees about anything from me. But if you learned something, a shoutout would be appreciated.
